			<h1>SEO tool</h1>

			<p>Have you ever wondered how Google search works? How exactly does it provide the websites that we are searching for?</p>

			<img src="../../image/seoImg.jpg">

			<p>Briefly expalined, when you type in a keyword in Google search box, Google crawls the internet across hundreds of thousands of pages(!) for the keyword that you have entered. The website which has the most number of occurrances of the website is displayed first and the other websites in descending order. This is the very basic working of Google or any other search engine for that matter.</p>

			<h2>Then what is SEO??</h2>

			<p>SEO stands for Search Engine Optimisation. It is to make sure that your website is the first link that is displayed when a user searches for the keyword relating to your website.</p>

			<h1>What is this project about?</h1>

			<p>The python script that I have written does a part of what Google's super secret algorithm does to find relevant websites and make users happy.</p>

			<p>There are two python scripts that I have written.</p>

			<h3>The first one</h3>

			<p>The first one is to find out the number of occurrances of a word in your website which greatly helps Search Engines such as Google display your website at the top. This python script allows the user to enter the URL of the website and search for the number of occurrances of the word. It then displays the frequency of the word in that particular website.</p>

			<h3>When is this helpful?</h3>

			<p>For example, there is a link in a website which says 'Find more about this topic here!'. You are exhausted reading through several websites already and don't want to read stuff anymore. You just want to know whether that website has something to do with the damn topic you are searching for. In that case, fret not! Just copy paste the url link from the website and find out how many times the word has occurred in the website. And Voila! Your work will be cut in half and double your time will be saved to do more fun stuff!!!</p>

			<h3>Pros</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Very user friendly (exceptional error handling)</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Cons</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Cannot search through multiple websites</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>The second one</h3>

			<p>This is very similar to the first one except that, this is more like Google. It searches through all the URLs that you enter and displays how many times it has occurred in a website. The one with most occurrances is probably the first place you should go and look for your answers.</p>

			<h3>When is this helpful?</h3>

			<p>Similar to the first one, but this time, it can handle multiple websites!!</p>

			<h3>Pros</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Can handle multiple websites</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Cons</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Error handling isn't very user friendly (i.e. user has to strictly follow the instructions)</li>
				<li>Speed at which the program runs depends on the user's computer/laptop</li>
			</ul>

			<h1>You can download the python scripts <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ROaYMTHr9tpxrXOBfQeKtyLuPhXNl1rR" target="_blank">here</a>!</h1>

			<h1>Instructions</h1>
			<h3>warning : you do need python installed in your OS to run this program. You can download it <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">here</a></h3>

			<p>Once you download and open the file don't be afraid!</p>

			<p>Follow these steps :</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Open the file by double-clicking on it (it will open in command prompt for Windows and Terminal for Mac users). (Check next point if this doesn't work)</li>
				<li>If the above method doesn't work, right-click on the python file and select the 'Edit with IDLE option' and it should open
					<ul>After it opens, ignore all the colorful lettering and press 'F5' on your keyboard to run it.</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Just a side note : when the first python runs, it will create an excel sheet and a .txt file in your directory. You can check explore those yourself, it contains the stats of the results</li>
